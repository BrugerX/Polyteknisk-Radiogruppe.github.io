The Radiogrouppe wil be presented to the students in the DSE PF student fair. We are going to show a demonstration of Music for oscilloscopes, showing the arcade machine and also some radio experiment. We are exited to present the association to all the new students. The event is organized by PF and DSE.

PF and DSE would like to invite you for our Study Fair. During the fair, you will have the opportunity to meet associations, organizations and clubs at DTU. This event will give you insight into what you can do in your free time and what you can gain by being part of different organizations.
