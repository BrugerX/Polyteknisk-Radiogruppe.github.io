### DESCRIPTION

In the past months we have been working on the installation of a HF antenna at the roof of the 101 Building, but we need some help from you to finish the installation, the last step is to build the antenna in the mast and raise it to the top. In this activity you will learn the basic elements of a HF antenna, how to install a antenna, and the most important, we will finally be able to transmit in HF.

The antenna is a Hex Beam antenna that is almost 7 meters long, so we will need help to place it on place. This project will let us to transmit if HF Bands and participate in contests. The antenna is a bit directive and it can be controller through a azimuth rotor, that is already installed and tested.
