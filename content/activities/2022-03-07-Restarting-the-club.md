### DESCRIPTION

After 2.5 years of moving the club from the basement up to our new rooms on the 1.s floor and due to COVID-19, we are now ready to open the club for all members. Thus, on the 16th of March at 18:00 we will officially open the club for all PRG's members. Therefore, you are invited to come by and say hello and chill.

All students at DTU, should now have access to the 1 floor and PRG's room via their student cards.

All non-students can come and get the guest card that they have applied for. We will make sure the doors are open for you.
